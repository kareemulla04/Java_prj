This Car Showroom simulator is an interactive Java application that allows users to select a car company and model, then calculates the final on-road price by adding optional charges such as CGST, SGST, and insurance using nested if statements. The project demonstrates object-oriented design concepts, including class inheritance, to provide a realistic experience simulating the car purchasing process in a simplified, user-friendly manner.
